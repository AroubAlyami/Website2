Hi you,

Here are some verified, peer-reviewed facts I’ve gathered over time:

1. You look better when you’re stressed, which is unfair.
2. Your voice notes should honestly be a paid podcast.
3. You sending pictures to make me feel better works every single time.
4. You disappearing does not make me forget you exist. Nice try though.

In conclusion:
You are deeply annoying (affectionate), surprisingly gentle, and very loved.

No further questions at this time.

You might not know this, but I love:

• How dramatic you are when you’re tired  
• How seriously you take food decisions  
• How you randomly remember details about me  
• How you pretend you’re calm when you are very much not calm  
• How protective you get in the most unserious ways  

You think you’re just existing.
You’re actually doing a lot.

Carry on.

I’m not building something loud.
I’m building something steady.

A space where we feel safe to be human.
Where stress doesn’t mean disappearance forever.
Where silence doesn’t mean loss.

We have a partnership where we protect each other’s hearts,
not test their limits.

This is the kind of love I’m choosing.
And I’m choosing it with you...always

Being with you feels easy in a way I didn’t expect.

Not effortless, but natural.
Like I don’t have to explain myself halfway through a sentence.
Like laughter shows up on its own.

You don’t overwhelm me.
You don’t drain me.
You make things feel lighter just by being there.

That matters more than you know.

I trust you not because you’re perfect (I can hear the "But I AM perfect"),
but because you’re honest.

You don’t pretend to be something you’re not.
You don’t perform feelings you don’t have.
When you care, it’s real.

I trust your intentions.
I trust your heart.
And I trust that when things matter, you show up in the way that counts.

That kind of trust isn’t loud.
It’s steady.

To whom it may concern,

I would like to report the following repeated offenses:

1. Being funny at inconvenient times.
2. Acting calm while clearly plotting nonsense.
3. Leaving me to miss you like it’s a hobby.

Requested resolution:
One (1) apology in the form of coffee.
Two (2) pictures that make me feel better.
And a strict policy against disappearing without explanation.

This report is submitted with affection and mild dramatic energy.

Sincerely,
Me
